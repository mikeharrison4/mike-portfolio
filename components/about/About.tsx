        <p>
          Hey, Iâ€™m Mike, a web developer/software engineer from the south coast of England.
          This site is a way for me to demonstrate my skills I have acquired over the
          last 5 years of being involved with everything connected with software development.
          It is a great place for me to have some fun and play around for the world to see.
